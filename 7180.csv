for passenger and freight trains or populated and diesel trains. This would get paid a much clearer picture of where emissions are falling and where more action might be needed to take.
 
When considering improvements, there could be some extra conceptual data that can be added, like how much of the network is running on electricity, the share of renewable electricity or total passenger numbers. This would help us understand whether that ambition drop is still due to long-term or temporary events, making the chart easier to interpret for future analysis.
 
Looking at it from a visual perspective, interactive visualisation could be used, allowing users to switch between different emission measures such as total emissions or emissions per passenger kilometre. This interactive chart can help them explore more complex data in deeper and better understanding, particularly for complex policy-relevant data (Cairo, 2016).
 
By marking some major events, it could be more accessible for the viewers, like COVID-19 or important policy changes. These notes can help them realise sudden changes in trends and avoid wrong conclusions.
 
In conclusion, it can be considered that figure 3 gives a clear and careful view of real emission trends and future scope in detailed context, and interactivity can make it better for supporting responsible decisions regarding the railway.
